#CONTRIBUTION PROCESS

To contribute to this repository, please create a branch on your local 
clone, push that branch to the repository, and create a Pull Request (PR)
for that branch. No commits can be directly added onto `master` - all 
must come via a Pull Request.

###Reviewers
All PRs must be approved by at least 2 reviewers before they can be merged.
Any team members can act as reviewer. All team members (dependent on 
their notifications settings) will be notified of new PRs, and are encouraged
to provide additional review comments whenever they can.

###Work items
Please link each PR to a work item from the current sprint. If no work items
are linked, the PR cannot be merged - a new work item should be raised in 
order to facilitate capturing the work being done.

If you reference a work item by id in a commit message - e.g. #12345 
Fixed issue where data was eaten by a grue - DevOps will auto link the item 
to the commit, and therefore the PR.

Otherwise you can manually link items at the point of PR creation, or 
afterwards, if necessary.

###Formatting
Please adhere to PEP8 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), the 
Python Style Guide. In particular, please

1) Indent with 4 spaces (not tabs).
1) Place 2 blank lines between top-level function and class definitions.
1) Place 1 blank line around method definitions within a class.
1) Place import statements at the top of the file, after any module comments
and docstrings.
1) Include a docstring for each function unless the function is extremely 
trivial - if in doubt, err on the side of more documentation. See 
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/ for full guidance on writing docstrings.
Note the use of triple-double quotes (""") to start and end docstrings.  

###Testing
All PRs should also contain tests that test the functionality within 
the PR. 

###Continuous integration
In the near future, Continuous Integration tests will run on each PR, to 
ensure that all tests pass before the PR can be merged into `master`. 
More details will be available when this is in place.
